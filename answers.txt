What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Both git merge and rebase are methods used to "combine" changes made on one branch with another branch. 
The primary difference the two is that git rebase attempts to eliminate the "branching" history by re-anchoring and creating new commits ON TOP OF the destination branch that you're rebasing onto.
This makes it so that the project development history can be viewed linearly whereas git merge keeps the branching history workflow after merging two branches.
It is important to make sure to get the most recent updates from the destination branch before attempting to merge or rebase in order to avoid merge conflicts.  
One drawback of the rebase is that you would have to fix each commit individually whereas merging you do not.
